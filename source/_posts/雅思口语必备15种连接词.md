# 雅思口语必备15种连接词

- 雅思口语有四个评分标准： Fluency &Coherence(流利度与连贯性)， Grammatical Range & Accuracy(语法广度及准确度), Lexical Resources (词汇范围和准确度) 和Pronunciation(发音)。
- 根据笔者观察，学生们往往对怎样提升流利度与连贯性不知所措，即便在家里把准备好的材料背的滚瓜烂熟，到了考场也常由于紧张或者有明显背诵的痕迹，取得一个非常糟糕的分数。虽然在一个较短的时间内大幅提升自己语言的连贯与流利不是件容易的事，但我们却可以通过口语中的一些过渡词，帮助自己消除紧张情绪。更重要的是，善于运用口语中的过渡词，可以大大消除背诵痕迹，让自己的语言变得更加自然，更具有逻辑性。
- 在雅思口语中，有15种过渡词使用的频率极高，可以帮助大家迅速提升口语交流的流利度与连贯性。
